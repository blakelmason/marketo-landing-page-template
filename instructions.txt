# CSS classes for Marketo

    .show-hide
        - Creates a toggleable element which can be shown / hidden.

    .btn-mkto
        - Creates a button with an editable link and text.


# MarketoCss.scss can be used to create the styling used by the Marketo variables in marketoVariables.js.
    - MarketoVariables.js contains an object which creates a variable in Marketo for each key.
    - Each variable can then be used in marketoCss.scss.
    - A $ must be put in front of the key when the key is used in marketoCss.scss.


# The MktoElement component can be used to create a Marketo Element Image, Text, or Form depending on which prop is passed as el.

# The src folder has all the files needed for building a template.
    - Useful global components can be found in the parent components folder.
    - Once a landing page is finished, run the gulp build command to build out the Marketo html template.
    - If you want to save a template, copy the src folder into content and rename it.
    - Then, replace the parent src folder with the src subfolder inside of the parent templates folder.
